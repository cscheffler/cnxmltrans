Hi Kathi, Mark

Specifically, I want to get the following work flow going for translation

 * Assume that a copy of the module has already been derived in
   Connexions and that its module number (?jargon) is known. This
   should eventually be automated through the API so that the user can
   type the number of an existing module into Connexions and the
   derivation happens automatically (or perhaps not, if this is a good
   phase during which to get the user to sign the licence).

 * Type the module number into the editor to start.

 * The editor pulls the CNXML and displays it in the edit window. XML
   tags are grayed out and not editable. However, the user can delete
   a tag by selecting a region of text that contains it and pressing
   <Delete>. This is a feature since users might want to remove or
   add, for example, <em></em> tags.

 * The editor autosaves in a cookie every minute or so. If the browser
   crashes, the editor will reload the latest copy of the current
   module when it is accessed again.

 * There are also save/load buttons that allow the user to save a copy
   of the text to the local disk. (Is this possible with browser
   security?)

 * When the user is ready to publish, they click the publish
   button. This runs a XML syntax checker, which will point out any
   errors. The CNXML is then submitted to Connexions via the SWORD
   API.

 * We still need to figure out the issues with licencing and
   publishing.
