 3. ed: the show/hide of maths requires internal state and modifies
    the text in the editor. Still need a post-process method for when
    the user saves or publishes the text (in order to replace the
    hidden mathml).

 4a ed: Migrated to CodeMirror-2.1. This did not fix the weird
    shift-select bug (see 4b).

Prioritised tasks:

 1. xml: Initial search for and evaluation of XML editors for expert
    users

 2. ed: deleting an allowed tag pair does not work if the tag contains
    attributes.

 4b ed: fix weird bug. when holding down shift and the left arrow to
    select text, the selection does not grow to the left as it
    should. however, when releasing the left arrow (while still
    holding shift) and then pressing and holding it again poses no
    problems. this effect does not occur when using the right
    arrow. This is in fact a bug inside CodeMirror itself.

 5. ed: autosave and recovery

 6. xml: Pull cnxml using SWORD. The editor should pull the MDML
    automatically.

 7. xml: Pull cnxml from personal (or other) workspace using the
    user's credentials (username and password) using SWORD.

 8. xml: Push back to Connexions using SWORD.

 9. ed: SWORD pull/push in the translation editor.

 10. ed and xml: publishing through SWORD.


Unprioritised tasks (nice to haves):

 * Use MathJax to display maths in the editor, rather than simply
   hiding it.

 * Grab and display images so the caption translation is in context.

Hi Kathi, Mark

Specifically, I want to get the following work flow going for translation

 * Assume that a copy of the module has already been derived in
   Connexions and that its module number (?jargon) is known. This
   should eventually be automated through the API so that the user can
   type the number of an existing module into Connexions and the
   derivation happens automatically (or perhaps not, if this is a good
   phase during which to get the user to sign the licence).

 * The editor autosaves in a cookie every minute or so. If the browser
   crashes, the editor will reload the latest copy of the current
   module when it is accessed again.

 * There are also save/load buttons that allow the user to save a copy
   of the text to the local disk. (Is this possible with browser
   security?)

 * When the user is ready to publish, they click the publish
   button. This runs a XML syntax checker, which will point out any
   errors. The CNXML is then submitted to Connexions via the SWORD
   API.

 * We still need to figure out the issues with licencing and
   publishing.

I think that we could live with the ugly maths for now but if we're
going to turn it into a classy tool eventually we might also be able to
use MathJax to just render the equations in the textarea. They'll take
up a ton less room but then we'd need to allow you to switch to MathML
view to edit.

No idea how possible these are but here are three things that seem like they
could be useful

   2. Grab and display images so the caption translation is in context.
   3. Show/Hide mathml (it can get very long and hairy). (This module has a
   bunch of math -- http://cnx.org/content/m11429/latest/ -- so you could
   take a look at http://cnx.org/content/m11429/latest/index.cnxml)

To get the cnxml for any module, go to
cnx.org/content/<moduleid>/<version>/index.cnxml
-- If you go to http://cnx.org/content you can click on "random module" to
get to one.
